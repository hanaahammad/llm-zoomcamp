Install Chocolatey (if not already installed) by following the instructions at [Chocolatey\\'s installation page](https://chocolatey.org/install).\\n\\n2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as an Administrator and run the following command:\\n   ```sh\\n   choco install wget\\n   ```\\n\\nAlternatively, if you prefer not to use Chocolatey, you can manually download a `wget` binary:\\n\\n1. Go to [this link](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/) to download the `wget` binary for Windows.\\n2. Extract the downloaded file and place the `wget.exe` in a directory of your choice, e.g., `C:/tools/`.\\n3.

Given that it is a simple model, it uses the least squares method to minimize the distance between the predicted values (y_pred) and the actual values (y). However, the linear model aims to generalize from the data rather than fit it perfectly to avoid overfitting. Hence, it balances the trade-off between bias and variance to provide a model that performs well on both the training set and unseen data.\\n\\nIn the case of a single feature, imagine plotting the data points on a graph and drawing the best-fit linear line through them. Since the model is linear, it cannot perfectly pass through all data points unless the points lie perfectly on a line, which is rarely the case in real-world data. Instead, it optimally positions the line to minimize overall prediction error while ensuring the model remains generalizable.\\n\\nIllustratively, to seek perfection with a single feature, you could use non-linear least squares methods (e.g., `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`), but this could lead to overfitting, making the model perform poorly on new, unseen data.',\n",

However, its necessity depends on the specific task being performed.\\n\\nIn the context of your module-04 homework:\\n\\n- The `random_state` parameter ensures reproducibility by setting the seed of the random number generator. This is particularly important when dealing with operations that involve randomness, such as shuffling the dataset or splitting the dataset into training and validation sets. By fixing the `random_state`, you ensure that every time you run the code, the splitting or shuffling produces the same result.\\n\\n- Specifically, for module-04:\\n  - In some questions, such as Qn2, using `random_state` might not be explicitly required if the task doesn't involve any operation where the randomness affects the outcome directly, or reproducibility is not a critical concern for understanding the core concept being taught.\\n  - In cases like Qn5, or when using methods like KFold cross-validation, where the random splitting of data can lead to different outcomes, setting `random_state` helps in generating consistent results, facilitating easier debugging and comparison of model performance across runs.\\n\\nAccording to the provided context:\\n- The use of `random_state` varies depending on the specific requirements of the task. For instance:\\n  - When using methods like `KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1)`, the `random_state` ensures that the dataset is split in a consistent manner across different runs, which is important for reproducibility.\\n  - While creating or evaluating models like `DecisionTreeClassifier`, setting `random_state` is crucial to get consistent metrics, such as AUC, on re-runs.\\n\\nTherefore, `random_state` is used selectively based on whether reproducibility of that particular step is required.\",\n",

I am wondering why and what is the right way, although it doesn't make a difference!\\nDid you try using a different random_state? From my understanding, KFold just makes N (which is equal to n_splits) separate pairs of datasets (train+val).\\nhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html\\nIn my case changing random state changed results\\n(Arthur Minakhmetov)\\nChanging the random state makes a difference in my case too, but not whether it is inside or outside the for loop. I think I have got the answer. kFold = KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle = True, random_state = 1)  is just a generator object and it contains only the information n_splits, shuffle and random_state. The k-fold splitting actually happens in the next for loop for train_idx, val_idx in kFold.split(df_full_train): . So it doesn't matter where we generate the object, before or after the first loop. It will generate the same information. But from the programming point of view, it is better to do it before the loop. No point doing it again and again inside the loop\\n(Bhaskar Sarma)\\nIn case of KFold(n_splits=n_splits, shuffle=True, random_state=1) and C= [0.01, 0.1, 1, 10], it is better to loop through the different values of Cs as the video explained. I had separate train() and predict() functions, which were reused after dividing the dataset via KFold. The model ran about 10 minutes and provided a good score.\\n(Ani Mkrtumyan)\",\n",
